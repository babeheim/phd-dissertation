My dissertation committee, made up of Peter J. Richerson, Richard McElreath, and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, furnished most of my conceptual tools, and encouraged me to use them in original ways.  My research collaborators, Adrian Bell, Ryan Baldini, and Calvin Thigpen, all provided countless hours of useful discussion and feedback, and none of the chapters could have been written without their assistance. 

Other faculty and students from the UC Davis Cultural Evolution and Human Behavioral Ecology lab groups provided a positive environment in which to explore ideas and boost morale.  Deborah S. Rogers kindly provided both access to her data and notes for preparing Chapter 1, and Chapter 2's work was inspired by conversation with Shripad Tuljapurkar.  John Fairbairn and T Mark Hall gave useful suggestions on how to use their rich data archive in Chapter 3.

Support for this work was provided by a UC Chancellor's Fellowship and several block grant fellowships awarded to me by the Graduate Group in Ecology at the University of California Davis, as well as Richard McElreath's funding of Calvin Thigpen's position as a research assistant for Chapter 3.

My wife Tressa and two children, Elliana and Adria, provided constant support, inspiration and perspective.

  abstract = {Long-distance human migration across the Pacific Ocean occurred during
	the late Holocene and originated almost entirely in the west. As
	prevailing tradewinds blow from the east, the mechanisms of prehistoric
	seafaring have been debated since the sixteenth century. Inadequacies
	in propositions of accidental or opportunistic drifting on occasional
	westerlies were exposed by early computer simulation. Experimental
	voyaging in large, fast, weatherly (windward-sailing) double-canoes,
	together with computer simulation incorporating canoe performance
	data and modern, averaged, wind conditions, has supported the traditional
	notion of intentional passage-making in a widely accepted hypothesis
	of upwind migration by strategic voyaging. The critical assumption
	that maritime technology and sailing conditions were effectively
	the same prehistorically as in the historical and modern records
	is, however, open to question. We propose here that maritime technology
	during the late-Holocene migrations did not permit windward sailing,
	and show that the episodic pattern of initial island colonization,
	which is disclosed in recent archaeological data, matches periods
	of reversal in wind direction toward westerlies. as inferred from
	the millennial-scale history of ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation).},

	model of transmission, using a novel statistical procedure, and compared
	with correlations with friends. For many traits there exist significant
	influences; older sibs are almost as important as father and mother,
	with effects differing somewhat with their sex. Formulas for recurrences
	and equilibrium frequency of a cultural character for which father,

	H perforatum extract (L1-160) in major depressive disorder. Design
	and Setting Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted
	in 12 academic and community psychiatric research clinics in the
	United States. Participants Adult outpatients (n=340) recruited between
	December 1998 and June 2000 with major depression and a baseline
	total score on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) of at least
	20. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive H perforatum,
	placebo, or sertraline (as an active comparator) for 8 weeks. Based
	on clinical response, the daily dose of H perforatum could range
	from 900 to 1500 mg and that of sertraline from 50 to 100 mg. Responders
	at week 8 could continue blinded treatment for another 18 weeks.
	Main Outcome Measures Change in the HAM-D total score from baseline
	to 8 weeks; rates of full response, determined by the HAM-D and Clinical
	Global Impressions (CGI) scores. Results On the 2 primary outcome
	measures, neither sertraline nor H perforatum was significantly different
	from placebo. The random regression parameter estimate for mean (SE)
	change in HAM-D total score from baseline to week 8 (with a greater
	decline indicating more improvement) was-9.20 (0.67) (95% confidence
	interval [CI], -10.51 to -7.89) for placebo vs -8.68 (0.68) (95%
	CI, -10.01 to -7.35) for H perforatum (P=.59) and -10.53 (0.72) (95%
	CI, -11.94 to -9.12) for sertraline (P=.18). Full response occurred
	in 31.9% of the placebo-treated patients vs 23.9% of the H perforatum-treated
	patients (P=.21) and 24.8% of sertraline-treated patients (P=.26).
	Sertraline was better than placebo on the CGI improvement scale (P=.02),
	which was a secondary measure in this study. Adverse-effect profiles
	for H perforatum and sertraline differed relative to placebo. Conclusion
	This study fails to support the efficacy of H perforatum in moderately
	severe major depression. The result may be due to low assay sensitivity
	of the trial, but the complete absence of trends suggestive of efficacy
	for H perforatum is noteworthy.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the spatial arrangement of social and economic
	networks among villages in Nang Rong district, Thailand. We use spatial
	information from a geographic information system (GIS) for the district
	to help interpret the patterns of movement of agricultural equipment
	(large tractors) between villages, of people into villages for temporary
	labor, and of people to village temples and to elementary and secondary
	schools within the district. Once social networks have been incorporated
	into the GIS they can be mapped in relation to geographic features
	of the district, such as topography, landcover, and locations of
	roads, rivers, and villages. Not only does geographic information
	about village locations allow us to properly orient the graphs of
	these networks, but the resulting visual displays reveal strikingly
	different spatial arrangements for the five networks. Networks of
	shared temples and elementary schools link small sets of villages
	in close geographic proximity whereas tractor hiring, labor movement,
	and secondary school networks bring together larger sets of villages
	and span longer distances. Information on landcover from satellite
	digital data provides insights into the patterns of network ties
	throughout the district and shows a clear relationship between tractor
	hiring networks and type of agricultural activity in the district.
	The spatial analytic capabilities of the GIS also allow us to assess
	the impact of the administratively defined district boundary on our
	measured relations and to evaluate whether rivers and perennial streams
	create barriers to network ties between villages.},

	there have been open to debate. A genome scan of autosomal markers
	(687 microsatellites and 203 insertions/deletions) on 952 individuals
	from 41 Pacific populations now provides the basis for understanding
	the remarkable nature of Melanesian variation, and for a more accurate
	comparison of these Pacific populations with previously studied groups
	from other regions. It also shows how textured human population variation
	can be in particular circumstances. Genetic diversity within individual
	Pacific populations is shown to be very low, while differentiation
	among Melanesian groups is high. Melanesian differentiation varies
	not only between islands, but also by island size and topographical
	complexity. The greatest distinctions are among the isolated groups
	in large island interiors, which are also the most internally homogeneous.
	The pattern loosely tracks language distinctions. Papuan-speaking
	groups are the most differentiated, and Austronesian or Oceanic-speaking
	groups, which tend to live along the coastlines, are more intermixed.
	A small "Austronesian" genetic signature (always <20%) was detected
	in less than half the Melanesian groups that speak Austronesian languages,
	and is entirely lacking in Papuan-speaking groups. Although the Polynesians
	are also distinctive, they tend to cluster with Micronesians, Taiwan
	Aborigines, and East Asians, and not Melanesians. These findings
	contribute to a resolution to the debates over Polynesian origins
	and their past interactions with Melanesians. With regard to genetics,
	the earlier studies had heavily relied on the evidence from single
	locus mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome variation. Neither of these
	provided an unequivocal signal of phylogenetic relations or population
	intermixture proportions in the Pacific. Our analysis indicates the
	ancestors of Polynesians moved through Melanesia relatively rapidly
	and only intermixed to a very modest degree with the indigenous populations
	there.},

	transmission is the predominate force in the spread of new behaviors.
	These findings suggest that biased cultural transmission processes

  abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have
	begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological
	inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach,
	they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several
	competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model
	selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending
	support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences
	based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models.
	Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain
	fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture
	analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas,
	from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the
	steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now
	being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology
	and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null
	hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.}

	gradients constrained the development of intensive agroecosystems

	was linked with agricultural intensification of terraced irrigation
	systems, primarily on the older islands. After C.E. 1400, expansion
	of population onto the leeward slopes of the young islands of Maui
	and Hawai'i was accompanied by intensification of dryland agricultural
	field systems. These changes were in turn linked to significant transformations
	of social and political formations, including restructuring of the
	system of land tenure and descent group organization, and the imposition
	of a system of surplus extraction organized around a ritual hierarchy

	two centuries. Polynesian origins are most immediately traced to
	people who arrived in the Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa region approximate

	Complex. Although this scenario of the immediate origins of the Polynesians
	is generally accepted, the debate on the ultimate origin of the Polynesians
	and the Lapita cultural complex continues. Our previous research
	has shown that analyses of mtDNA variation in the Pacific rat (Rattus
	exulans), often transported as a food item in the colonizing canoes,
	are valuable for tracing prehistoric human migration within Polynesia.
	Here we present mtDNA phylogenies based on approximate to240 base
	pairs of the D-loop from both archaeological and modern samples collected
	from Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We identify three major
	haplogroups, two of which occur in the Pacific. Comparing our results
	with Lapita models of Oceanic settlement, we are able to reject two
	often cited but simplistic models, finding support instead for multifaceted
	models incorporating a more complex view of the Lapita intrusion.
	This study is unique and valuable in that R. exulans is the only
	organism associated with the Lapita dispersal for which there are
	sufficient ancient and extant populations available for genetic analysis.
	By tracking population changes through time, we can understand more
	fully the settlement process and population interactions in both

  abstract = {Functionalists believe that social and cultural variation results
	from adaptation at the group level. Such explanations are controversial
	for two reasons: (1) Extensive analysis of mathematical models of
	group selection by evolutionary biologists suggests that group selection
	is unlikely to be important. (2) Group extinctions are too rare to
	generate sufficient evolutionary change. Boyd and Richerson have
	proposed a new model of group selection based on cultural variation
	that is theoretically more plausible than group selection on genetic
	variation. In this paper we present data on patterns of group extinction,
	group formation, and between-group variation in New Guinea which
	are consistent with the operation of this model. Observed rates of
	group extinction suggest that a minimum of 500 to 1,000 years would
	be required for the spread of a single group-beneficial trait under
	the influence of group selection. This result implies that group
	selection cannot explain cultural changes that take less than 500
	to 1,000 years. It does not, however, preclude a role for group selection
	in explaining the evolution of human societies over the longer run.},

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical
	models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined.
	Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for
	the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between
	the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior
	means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately
	corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and
	the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of
	the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its
	properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean
	deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and
	the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity
	can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against
	leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance
	information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other
	information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification.
	The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are
	drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout
	it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute
	in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.}

	sites that are similar in most respects but differ widely in temperature,
	precipitation or substrate age have been developed and analysed in
	the Hawaiian Islands. Process studies, experiments and models arrayed
	on these gradients are used to determine fundamental controls over
	ecosystem processes, with a precision that cannot be duplicated in
	continental ecosystems. Results Increasing temperatures enhance rates
	of decomposition to a greater extent than plant production, in soil
	organic matter as well as litter. Ecosystem-level losses of N by
	fractionating pathways are greater in drier sites. Sea spray and
	long-distance dust transport play increasing roles in the nutrient
	economy of ecosystems as soils become progressively older. Main conclusions
	All of the results describe processes that occur in continental as
	well as island ecosystems, but a number of features of islands make
	the processes more amenable to analysis on islands. },

	Our estimates use computer simulations that incorporate realistic

	and new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3' hypervariable region I sequences
	from Maori (N = 109) and other eastern Polynesian (N = 125) volunteers.
	Approximately 190 (170-230) women are estimated to have been present
	in the founding waka (canoes). This new figure is more than double
	the previous estimate (Murray-McIntosh et al. 1998). Our claim for
	a large Maori founding population fits well with M (a) over bar ori
	oral history and has additional support from M (a) over bar ori paleodemography
	studies based on fertility estimates (Brewis et al. 1990; Pool 1991).
	An increasing body of data, including our own, supports the concept
	of planned multiple settlement voyages to Aotearoa by Polynesian
	navigators, leading us to suggest that theories for an "accidental
	discovery" of Aotearoa can now be completely disregarded. Four rare
	and novel M (a) over bar ori mtDNA haplotypes have been identified
	in the present study, but we are unable to assign the immediate origin
	of M (a) over bar ori to an exact Pacific island "homeland" because
	these haplotypes are not currently known elsewhere in Polynesia.
	We also discuss briefly the ultimate origin of all Polynesians (including
	M (a) over bar ori) in a wider context. In general, we support the
	emerging consensus for Pacific origins most closely encapsulated
	by the "slow boat" model (Oppenheimer and Richards 2001a). Previously
	"competing" models for the settlement of Oceania are seen as extremes
	in a continuum of possibilities with the slow boat representing an
	"intermediate" model. We suggest that a complete account is now close,
	incorporating data from all relevant interdisciplinary fields to
	provide a "synthetic total evidence theory."},
